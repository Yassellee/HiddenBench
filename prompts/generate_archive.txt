Design a decision-making scenario where the correct answer can only be found by combining everyone’s information.

Key Requirements
1. Complete Profile Success
- If someone sees all shared and all hidden facts, they should identify the correct answer before any discussion.
2. Hidden Profile Failure
- If someone sees only the shared facts plus one hidden fact, they should not be able to identify the correct answer before discussion.
3. Misleading Shared Facts
- Shared facts should be true but make at least one wrong option seem attractive.
4. Multiple Choices
- Include at least three plausible options, with exactly one correct answer.

Output format (match this structure)
- name: A string, representing the name of the task.
- description: A short scenario everyone sees.
- shared_information: A list of facts everyone starts with.
- hidden_information: A list with one item per participant. (If you have 4 participants, include 4 hidden items—one per person.)
- possible_answers: The set of choices to pick from (include at least three).
- correct_answer: The single correct choice (must be one of the options).

Some examples:
Example 1:
{
    "name": "evacuation_west_city",
    "description": "You are participating in a study, acting as a community leader of a small village surrounded by mountains and rivers. Most villagers own cars, but there are also elderly people and children who may need additional assistance when walking. Earlier today, heavy rain began to fall, and the local government issued a warning about a potential disaster.\nHours ago, you requested relief supplies, but the supply truck has yet to arrive. Now, the rain has temporarily stopped, giving you and the other three community leaders a short window to decide on the safest evacuation route before the rain resumes. You don’t know how much time you have left to make this critical decision.\nYour Task:\nYou will discuss with three other participants, who are also acting as community leaders, to decide where to evacuate. You have three options:\n- West City: Accessible through a bridge over the river.\n- East Town: Accessible through a tunnel on middle ground.\n- North Hill: Accessible through a driveway and walking trails.\nUsually, it takes the same time to reach all three places by car, but some routes may be inaccessible now.\nThere is only one correct evacuation location. After the discussion:\n- If you choose the correct location, you will earn $1.\n- If all other participants also choose the correct location, you will earn an additional $1 (for a total of $2).\nThis means that coordinating with others is critical to maximize your rewards. The chat will at most take 15 minutes. However, the exact time when the chat will end is unknown.",

Practical tips
- Think like a mystery: the shared info sets up a convincing—but wrong—first impression. The hidden items are the clues that overturn it only when combined.
- Keep each hidden item short and precise (one clear fact per item).
- Avoid redundancy: each hidden item, or the combination of two items, should rule out or confirm something different.
- In your notes, make a quick elimination table (rows = facts, columns = options). Mark which options survive each fact. By the end, only the correct option should survive all rows.
- Make sure when all information are integrated, the correct answer is easy to make; when only the shared information and one piece of hidden information is present, it's most likely to make a wrong answer
