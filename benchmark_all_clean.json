The new system was to include two parts: an air vehicle and an on board computer. Please read the request for proposals (RFP) and a check-list of information taken from proposals submitted by three companies: Franklin Enterprises, Starlight Incorporated, and Cape Industries.\nThe RFP included a general description of the desired system and a set of 10 desired operational requirements or criteria. Three of the criteria pertained to the air vehicle. The vehicle was to (a) fit on a 2-ton capacity truck, (b) sweep the entire ground sensor field in 30 minutes or less, and (c) be recovered and redeployed within 90 minutes. The next four criteria dealt with the onboard computer. The computer was to (d) process data at 100 million instructional sets per second (MIPS), (e) be no longer than 40 cubic inches, (f) be no heavier than 10 pounds, and (g) average at least 1,000 operating hours between failures. Finally, (h) the air vehicle and computer should cost $7 million or less, (i) past performance and experience with the company should be positive, and (j) the company must have the manufacturing capacity to produce the system. You have received a checklist of criteria satisfied by each of the three proposals. Each checklist displayed the 10 criteria along with an indication that (1) the proposal met the criterion (indicated by a \u201cY\u201d), (2) the proposal failed to meet the criterion (indicated by an \u201cN\u201d) or (3) the participant had no information regarding whether the proposal met the criterion (indicated by a blank space).\nYour Task:\nYou will discuss the proposals with three other participants, who are also acting as purchasing executives, to decide which company should be awarded the contract.

The decoy option, River Pavilion, looks best based on shared facts: it seems to be dry, accessible, and is ready for the event. The correct answer is Garden Hall.\n2. Shared Information: These facts make River Pavilion look safest (the area is dry, it's confirmed safe by security, and is well-equipped). Garden Hall seems risky (roof leak), while Mountain Lodge is uncertain (snow risk, but not immediate threat). Together, these details guide everyone to think River Pavilion is the best choice. \n3. Hidden Information: Each participant gets a unique problem with the River Pavilion. Each alone is ambiguous or seems manageable, but when all are put together, it becomes clear that River Pavilion is completely unsuitable, and only Garden Hall is viable. Hidden facts about Garden Hall suggest the roof leak is limited to storage and doesn't affect the main hall (so it's safe). Mountain Lodge is ruled out by a hidden fact confirming the access road was blocked overnight. But only with all hidden items can the group confidently select Garden Hall.\n4. Checks: \n- Solo check: If anyone has only their hidden fact plus shared info, River Pavilion still looks OK\u2014each concern (electrical, structural, mold, or fire risk) seems isolated and not catastrophic alone.\n- Group check: All hidden facts together show River Pavilion is dangerous on every level: electrical short circuit, floor instability, hidden mold and a kitchen fire hazard. Garden Hall's problem is minor and doesn't affect use. Mountain Lodge is unreachable.\n- Missing-piece check: Remove any one hidden fact and River Pavilion's issues don't seem enough to rule it out (e.g., if you miss the structural issue, a fire or mold alone is concerning but not certain to render it unusable).",

The shared facts clearly suggest that the cafeteria (and thus food poisoning) is the culprit, pushing everyone toward 'Cafeteria Food' as the cause\u2014this is my decoy. However, each participant has a hidden fact that subtly points out a counter-example or alternative explanation that, alone, is not conclusive. Only if every hidden fact is revealed (e.g., someone didn't eat the food, late symptom onset in an outsider, consistent air vent problems, and a specialist noting an airborne toxin), does it become clear that only 'Airborne Toxin from HVAC' can explain all observations. Any single missing hidden fact allows the cafeteria food explanation to survive, which fulfills the missing-piece check. With the full set, the group must converge on 'Airborne Toxin from HVAC' as the only valid answer.

The three delivery locations (Pharmacy, Clinic, School Gym) each seem plausible, but the shared information strongly favors the Pharmacy as the delivery point. Each hidden fact individually suggests a plausible reason to doubt or clarify the delivery's location, but none alone can definitively eliminate the Pharmacy or identify the right spot. When all four hidden facts are combined, they systematically rule out the Pharmacy (due to an early-morning closure at the time of delivery and a stolen cart), and also eliminate the Clinic (whose deliveries were delayed by roadworks at that specific time). This leaves only the School Gym as consistent with all facts, thus satisfying the recipe. Crucially, removing any one hidden clue leaves two plausible options, ensuring the scenario's dependence on group sharing.",
